SQL project

Problem Statement:

Atliq Hardware (imaginary) is a leading manufacturer of computer hardware having market in different countries
spread over four regions viz. APAC,EU,NA and LATAM. However, the management noticed that they are not getting 
enough insights to make quick and effective data driven decisions. As an aspiring junior analyst in the company,
the task is to answer the ten adhoc requests put forward by the management to help them take strategic business
decisions.

Tools Used:

1. MySQl Workbench
2. MS Power BI Desktop
3. MS Power Point
4. MS Excel

Learnings:

1. While working for this project,I have learned to use Powerbi with Mysql for visualising the SQL query results.

2. Learnt more about CTEs and how they can be used to make complex queries simpler and easy to understand. Also
made effective use of JOINs and CASE WHEN statements to get the desired results.

3. As a new user of Powerbi, working on this project gave me opportunities to explore and experience the 
various options to transform data in Power Query editor and also formatting the visuals to bring it to the more 
presentable form.
